  <h2>Description<h2>
  <p>Nothing beats tender, juicy sirloin steak perfectly braaied over blazing coals. Use our expertly blended Robertsons Braai & Grill Spicy BBQ to enhance all the gorgeous meaty flavours in the beef, then served with stuffed mushrooms or a grilled vegetable and couscous salad</p>
  <STRONG>Ingredients</STRONG>
  <ul>
    <li>600 g - 700 g sirloin steak</li>
    <li>30 my sunflower oil</li>
    <li>30ml Robertsons Braai & Grill Spicy BBQ</li>
    <li>50 g butter</li>
    <li>30 ml Dijon mustard</li>
  </ul>
  <STRONG>Steps</STRONG>
  <ol>
    <li>Take the steaks out of the fridge for about an hour before you cook them, to bring them up to room temperature. Brush them with oil and season generously with Robertsons Braai & Grill Spicy BBQ.</li>
    <li>Place on a grid over hot coals and braai for just long enough to brown the meat on all sides.</li>
    <li>Place a big heat-safe or cast-iron pan on the grid. Add the butter and Dijon mustard.</li>
    <li>Place the steaks in the pan and coat them well with the butter mixture. Cook the steaks in the pan until done to your likeness. As a rough guide, it will take 2-3 minutes for rare, 5-6 minutes for medium, and 8-10 minutes for well done.</li>
    <li>Let the steaks rest on a plate for at least half the time they took to cook before slicing and serving them.</li>
 </ol>
